# FizzBuzz Generator
This is a kata to practice TDD, BabySteps and Problem Description.

The Fizz Buzz generator is a simple program, itâ€™s method say generate accepts the numeric input and produces the output string based on the rules and input number.

### Rules
The generate method returns the string

- FizzBuzz when input parameter is divisible by 3 and 5.
- Fizz when input parameter is divisible by 3.
- Buzz when input parameter is divisible by 5.
- String representation of given number when input parameter neither divisible by 3 or 5.

### It is clear that there are four use cases to implement

FizzBuzz As a fizz buzz generator, I should be able to generate a string FizzBuzz for a given input number when the number is divisible by 3 and 5.

Fizz As a fizz buzz generator, I should be able to generate a string Fizz for a given input number when the number is divisible by 3.

Buzz As a fizz buzz generator, I should be able to generate a string Buzz for a given input number when the number is divisible by 5.

Number (converted to string) As a fizz buzz generator, I should be able to generate a string format of input number for a given input number when number is neither divisible by 3 or 5.
